\section{Making Tempeh}

Tempeh is a fermented soy bean product originating in Indonesia. To make tempeh, soak the soy beans in water for half a day. Then pressure cook the beans. Make sure the beans are not overcooked. They should be soft to squeeze, but not mushy. After that, clean the soy beans so most husks are removed. Then add the tempeh starter culture mixed with rice flour and some vinegar. The tempeh will be ready after two to three days of fermentation.

When fermenting the beans, a plastic bag is preferred. Punctuate the bag with a sharp knife or pin at 2cm intervals, so air can reach the tempeh. The preferred fermentation temperature is 38\,째C, but a temperature above 25\,째C will suffice.

After the fermentation is complete, white fungal mycelia will have grown around the beans. The formerly loose beans will now form a solid board.

Tempeh should be stored refrigerated. It will keep for up to a week, when refrigerated at 4\,째C. The culture may begin to sporulate, which results in small black spots. These spots are fine to eat.

\section{Cooking with Tempeh}

In most cases tempeh will be marinated like meat. You can choose your own marinade, but we provide a simple one below.
